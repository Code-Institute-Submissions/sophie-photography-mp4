## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the studio.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find examples of previous work.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their clients think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        4. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to book a photoshoot session and understand how it works.
        5. I want to register an account, easily login or logout, receive a confirmation email after registering and have a personalized user profile.
